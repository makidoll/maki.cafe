# maki.cafe

Built with **Next.js** and **Chakra UI**

Also https://makidoll.io

Used to be built with Angular in [outdated-angular-version](https://github.com/makidoll/maki.cafe/tree/outdated-angular-version) branch

-   `pnpm install`
-   `pnpm make` generates spritesheets
-   `pnpm start` develop
-   `pnpm build && pnpm serve` deploy

I'd like to rewrite this with Vite some day to optimize everything myself, and drop Chakra
